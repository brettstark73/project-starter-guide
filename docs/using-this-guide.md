### The Sweet Spot
Use **this guide to decide and structure**, then use **chat to customize and accelerate**.

---

## üöÄ Recommended Workflow

### 1. Define Your Project Scope
Before opening a template or chatting with AI, clarify:

**Requirements:**
- What problem are you solving?
- Who is the audience?
- What are the core features (MVP)?

**Constraints:**
- Timeline (days, weeks, months?)
- Budget ($0, $50/mo, $500/mo, enterprise?)
- Team size (solo, 2-5, 5+?)
- Technical expertise (beginner, intermediate, expert?)

**Success Criteria:**
- What does "done" look like?
- What performance/scale is needed?
- What compliance/security requirements exist?

### 2. Classify Complexity

Map your project to one of 5 levels:

| Level | Characteristics | Timeline | Examples |
|-------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **1** | Static, no backend | 1-7 days | Portfolio, landing page |
| **2** | Frontend + API calls | 1-3 weeks | Weather app, calculators |
| **3** | Full-stack, auth, DB | 2-8 weeks | SaaS MVP, dashboards |
| **4** | Scalable, caching, queues | 2-6 months | High-traffic apps |
| **5** | Distributed, multi-region | 6+ months | Enterprise systems |

üìñ **Read:** [Complexity Levels Guide](complexity-levels.md) for detailed criteria

### 3. Pick Your Project Type

Choose the closest match:

- **üìÑ [Static Sites](project-types/static-sites.md)** ‚Üí Portfolio, docs, blogs
- **üíº [SaaS Applications](project-types/saas-applications.md)** ‚Üí Subscription products, dashboards
- **üîå [APIs & Microservices](project-types/apis.md)** ‚Üí Backend services, data APIs
- **üì± [Mobile Applications](project-types/mobile-apps.md)** ‚Üí iOS/Android apps
- **üõí [E-commerce](project-types/ecommerce.md)** ‚Üí Online stores, marketplaces
- **üìä [Data & Analytics](project-types/data-analytics.md)** ‚Üí Pipelines, dashboards, ML

### 4. Choose Your Technology Stack

Consult the [Technology Matrix](technology-matrix.md):

**Consider:**
- Your team's existing skills
- Ecosystem maturity (libraries, community)
- Hosting/deployment options
- Budget constraints

**Important:**
- Check the [Pricing Disclaimer](technology-matrix.md#pricing-disclaimer)
- Verify current free tier limits
- Review database providers (Neon, Turso, D1)

### 5. Start from a Template

Clone the matching starter template:

```bash
# Example: SaaS project
cp -r templates/saas-level-1 my-project
cd my-project
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

**Available templates:**
- [About-Me Page](../templates/about-me-page/) (HTML/CSS/JS)
- [SaaS Level 1](../templates/saas-level-1/) (Next.js 15)
- [API Service](../templates/api-service/) (Express + TypeScript)
- [Mobile App](../templates/mobile-app/) (Expo SDK 52)

### 6. Tailor with AI Chat

Now is when AI chat becomes powerful. You have a working baseline; ask for specific customizations.

**High-Leverage Prompts:**

**Architecture & Stack:**
```
Given these requirements:
- [Your requirements]
- Timeline: [X weeks]
- Budget: [$X/month]

Map to this guide's Complexity Level and Project Type.
Suggest a stack from the Technology Matrix.
Call out risks and alternatives.
```

**Feature Implementation:**
```
Using the SaaS Level 1 template, add:
- Supabase Auth (email + Google OAuth)
- Stripe Checkout for subscription billing
- User dashboard with usage metrics

List files to change and environment variables needed.
```

**Database Integration:**
```
Add PostgreSQL (Neon) to the API service template:
- Connection pooling
- Migration setup
- Example CRUD endpoints
- Error handling

Show the code changes as git patches.
```

**Problem-Solving:**
```
I'm getting [error] when deploying to Vercel.
My stack: Next.js 15, Supabase, static export.

Debug this based on the Known Pitfalls in the static-sites guide.
```

**Trade-off Analysis:**
```
For a read-heavy analytics dashboard with 10K users:
- Compare Neon vs Turso vs Cloudflare D1
- Consider the free tier limits from the Technology Matrix
- Factor in global distribution needs
- Recommend based on [my constraints]
```

### 7. Validate Before Deployment

Run the verification checklist from your project type guide:

**Example (SaaS):**
```bash
# From docs/project-types/saas-applications.md
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --view
```

Check the "Pre-Launch Verification Checklist" in your guide:
- Security (env vars, auth, rate limiting)
- Payments (webhook testing, failed payments)
- Performance (Lighthouse score, load times)
- Legal (privacy policy, terms of service)

### 8. Iterate with Known Pitfalls

Before adding features, review "Known Pitfalls & Gotchas":
- **Static Sites:** Next.js static export limitations, image optimization
- **SaaS:** Over-engineering, auth gotchas, database pooling
- **APIs:** CORS config, rate limiting, error handling
- **Mobile:** Memory leaks, bundle size, platform-specific issues

These sections show ‚ùå wrong vs ‚úÖ correct approaches with code.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-Customizing Before MVP
**‚ùå Wrong:**
```
I cloned the SaaS template, but I'm rewriting the entire auth system,
adding microservices, and custom database layer before getting first user.
```

**‚úÖ Right:**
```
I used the SaaS template as-is, added my core features (10% of code),
launched to beta users, now iterating based on feedback.
```

**Lesson:** Stick to the template structure until you have real user feedback.

### 2. Ignoring the Checklists
**‚ùå Wrong:**
```
I skipped the verification checklist and deployed.
Now I have CORS issues, rate limiting isn't working, and there's no error tracking.
```

**‚úÖ Right:**
```
I ran through the Pre-Launch Checklist:
- CORS configured for production domains
- Rate limiting tested (got 429 response)
- Sentry error tracking set up
```

**Lesson:** Checklists catch 80% of common issues. Don't skip them.

### 3. Treating Chat as Authoritative on Pricing
**‚ùå Wrong:**
```
Chat said Neon free tier is 1 GB storage, so I built my app assuming that.
(Actual limit: 0.5 GB/branch as of 2025)
```

**‚úÖ Right:**
```
Chat suggested Neon. I checked the Technology Matrix pricing disclaimer,
then verified current limits at neon.com/pricing before committing.
```

**Lesson:** Always verify pricing/quotas with provider docs. Chat can be outdated.

### 4. Skipping Known Pitfalls
**‚ùå Wrong:**
```
I deployed my Next.js static site but images don't load and API routes 404.
I didn't check the Known Pitfalls section.
```

**‚úÖ Right:**
```
I read Known Pitfalls before deploying:
- Added 'unoptimized: true' for static export
- Moved API logic to Vercel serverless functions
- Used absolute URLs for og:image
```

**Lesson:** Known Pitfalls sections contain battle-tested solutions. Read them first.

### 5. Not Running Local Validation
**‚ùå Wrong:**
```
I pushed to production and discovered broken links, accessibility issues,
and a 500 error in checkout during peak traffic.
```

**‚úÖ Right:**
```
Before deploying, I ran Local Validation commands:
- npm test (caught auth bug)
- npm run build (caught type error)
- npx lighthouse (fixed contrast issues)
- Load tested checkout (added DB index)
```

**Lesson:** Catch issues locally before users do. It's 10x cheaper.
